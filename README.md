Requirements Engineering:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall Model	Approach is Sequential and linear while Agile approach is	Iterative and incremental
Water fall model approach is Flexibility	Low, difficult to accommodate changes while Agile approach is	High, and easy to adapt to changes
Water fall model Documentation is Comprehensive  at each phase while for Agile model it Less emphasis on documentation, more on working software

The Waterfall and Agile methods provide diverse benefits and are appropriate for different sorts of projects. The Waterfall model's structured approach is useful for projects with well-defined requirements and little modifications, whereas the Agile model's flexibility and iterative process are appropriate for projects with changing requirements and the need for regular stakeholder feedback. The decision between these models is determined by project-specific considerations such as requirement stability, project size, client participation, and the development team's capabilities.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements engineering is a critical procedure in the SDLC that ensures the software product aligns with the user needs and expectations.

Elicitation:
Gather requirements from stakeholders.
Analysis:
Understand and clarify the gathered requirements.
Specification:
Document the requirements in a detailed and structured manner.
Validation:
Ensure the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible.
Management:
Handle changes and ensure traceability of requirements throughout the SDLC.
Importance of Requirements Engineering:
Alignment ensures software fulfils user and stakeholder needs.
Reduced Development Costs: Identifying and resolving requirement concerns early in the process lowers the cost of change and rework.
Improved Quality: Clear and validated requirements result in higher-quality software that works as intended.
Better Project Planning: Detailed requirements facilitate effective project estimation and planning.
Enhanced Communication: Ensures that all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and project managers, have a consistent understanding and clear documentation.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is a fundamental notion in software design that improves the maintainability, scalability, and adaptability of software systems. By dividing a system into self-contained modules, developers can control complexity, enable parallel development, and create robust and adaptive solutions. Implementing modularity using deliberate design concepts and approaches results in software that is easier to develop, test, maintain, and grow.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing
Validate that individual components (units) of the software work correctly in isolation.
Focuses on the smallest parts of the application, such as functions, methods, or classes.
Conducted by developers during the development phase.
Integration Testing
Verify that different units or components work together as intended.
Focuses on interactions between integrated units or modules.
Conducted after unit testing.
System Testing
Validate the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Focuses on the entire system, including interactions between components and external interfaces.
Conducted after integration testing.
Acceptance Testing
Validate that the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for delivery to the end-users.
Focuses on verifying that the software meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.
Conducted after system testing, often in a real-world or simulated environment.
These levels  work together to enable thorough testing coverage, from individual units to the complete system, as well as verification that the software meets technical and user criteria. By efficiently executing these stages of testing, organisations may offer high-quality software that is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.
